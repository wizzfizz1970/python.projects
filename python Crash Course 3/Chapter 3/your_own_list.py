'''3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a
motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list
to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a
Honda motorcycle.”'''

transport = ['car', 'bus', 'train']
message = 'Hello how are you today '
print(message + transport[0].title())
print(message + transport[1].title())
print(message + transport[2].title())
